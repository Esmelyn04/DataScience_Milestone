# DataScience_Milestone_1
Data Science Project. NYC Yellow Taxi Trips
I worked with Python (Programming Language) and libraries Pandas, Seaborn, NumPy, Matplot, and Sklearn. 
I Implemented data cleaning from the dataset and I analyzed the data distribution with graphs. 
I applied the Decision Tree Regression model and the K-Nearest Neighbors Regression model to predict the yellow taxi trip fare amount
